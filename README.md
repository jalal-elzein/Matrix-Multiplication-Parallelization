# Matrix Multiplication Parallelization
This is a project that I made as part of my CSC447 - Parallel Computing course at LAU.  
The task is to compare the parallelization of matrix multiplication with OpenMP versus manual Multithreading.  

# What's in this repo?
File Name | Description
--- | ---
openmp.cpp | OpenMP Implementation of Matrix Multiplication
README.md | you're reading it :p 
report.md | Markdown source of my final report
Report.pdf | My final submission to my instructor
sequential.cpp | Sequential Implementation of Matrix Multiplication
threadripper.cpp | Manual Multithreading Implementation of Matrix Multiplication

# What technologies were used?
The code is written entirely in C++  
No external or additional libraries need to be installed for this to work  
Libraries used are `thread`, `chrono`, and `omp.h`  

# Try it yourself!
Commands to compile and run these programs are included as comments in the last 2 lines of every source file.  
No additional set up is required!
